This repo has all derivatives pricing models, including a standard Black-Scholes theoretical pricer with inputs for all variables, as well as a monte carlo simulation with user inputs that determine the values for the variables, with subsequent calculations based on the BS equation.


The "BS_montecarlo.py" file is the program with user inputs.
