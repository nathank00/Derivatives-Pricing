## This repo has all of my derivatives pricing models, including:
### A standard Black-Scholes theoretical pricer with inputs for all variables (BS_standard.ipynb)
### a monte carlo simulation that takes user inputs for the variable values, with subsequent calculations based on the BS equation and referencing Yahoo Finance data using the yahoo_fin package (BS_montecarlo.py)
